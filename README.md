This is a toy project made in half an hour to demonstrate what can be done with Apple's `FlightUtilities` private framework 😁

## Usage

Just launch the app and type a flight code (including the airline code). Example: `AA24` for American Airlines flight number 24.

### Disclaimer

This is just a toy project I made to test the FlightUtilities framework added to OS X on version 10.11.4. The framework is private and I should not be using It 😅

Apple will probably add something to OS X (or macOS?) in the future which uses this framework.
